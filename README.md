# Programming-Questions
This repository involves 1000+ pracitised programming questions with solutions.
It has questions from C and C++ language. It has all topics covered from basics to advanced .
I have practiced many such questions in this file and i will also continue uploading more questions of different programming languages i will master.

# C Language
C is a procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie. It focuses on functions and step-by-step instructions to solve problems. It is fast, efficient, and widely used for system programming and embedded systems.It follows a top-down approach where a program is divided into smaller functions that execute sequentially. C provides low-level memory access through pointers, fast execution speed, and close interaction with hardware, which makes it suitable for operating systems, embedded systems, and compiler development. However, it does not support classes or direct object-oriented features.

# C++
C++ is an extension of C that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. It introduces concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, making programs more secure and reusable.It supports classes, objects, constructors, destructors, function overloading, operator overloading, and templates. C++ follows both top-down and bottom-up design approaches, making it suitable for developing complex and large-scale applications such as games, software systems, and real-time applications while maintaining performance efficiency similar to C.

# OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)

OOPS is a programming approach that organizes code using objects and classes to model real-world entities. It focuses on data security and modular program design through four main principles: Encapsulation (binding data and methods together), Abstraction (hiding internal implementation details), Inheritance (reusing properties of existing classes), and Polymorphism (same function behaving differently in different situations). OOP improves code reusability, scalability, maintainability, and reduces program complexity in large software development.

Main principles:

- Encapsulation – binding data and methods together

- Abstraction – hiding implementation details

- Inheritance – reusing properties of another class

- Polymorphism – one interface, multiple behaviors
