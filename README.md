# Programming-Questions
This repository involves 1000+ pracitised programming questions with solutions.
It has questions from C and C++ language. It has all topics covered from basics to advanced .
I have practiced many such questions in this file and i will also continue uploading more questions of different programming languages i will master.

# C Language
C is a procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie. It focuses on functions and step-by-step instructions to solve problems. It is fast, efficient, and widely used for system programming and embedded systems.

# C++
C++ is an extension of C that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. It introduces concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, making programs more secure and reusable.

# OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)

OOPS is a programming approach that organizes code using objects and classes to model real-world entities.

Main principles:

- Encapsulation – binding data and methods together

- Abstraction – hiding implementation details

- Inheritance – reusing properties of another class

- Polymorphism – one interface, multiple behaviors
